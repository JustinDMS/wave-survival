# Overview
I was playing some Call of Duty zombies and thought to myself "I bet I could make this", and this is the result. The goals for this project was to learn more about composition-based design and to properly utitilze Godot's node structure to remain as decoupled as possible.

Some of the features of the project:
- 8 direction player controller
- Health system
- Separate weapon, projectile, and ammo components
- Random drop system
- Point/scoring system
- Enemy and AI components
- Wave and spawning system
